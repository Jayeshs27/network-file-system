## Network File System
This system comprises three major components: Clients, Naming Server, and Storage Servers, each playing a vital role in facilitating efficient file management and access within a network environment.

#### 1. Clients 
Clients are the systems or users interacting with the NFS, initiating various file operations such as reading, writing, and deleting. They serve as the primary interface for accessing files within the network file system.


#### 2. Naming Server
The Naming Server serves as the central hub in the NFS architecture, orchestrating communication between clients and storage servers. Acting as a directory service, it provides crucial information to clients about the specific storage server where requested files or folders reside, ensuring efficient and accurate file access.

#### 3. Storage Servers
Storage Servers form the backbone of the NFS, responsible for physical storage and retrieval of files and folders. They manage data persistence and distribution across the network, ensuring secure and efficient storage of files.

  This project aims to provide a robust and scalable solution for file management within a network environment, offering reliability, efficiency, and ease of access to users and systems. With a focus on seamless integration and performance optimization, the NFS project strives to enhance file sharing and collaboration across diverse computing environments.
